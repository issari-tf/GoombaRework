# GoombaRework

### Goomba Plugin for Issari's server. 

Fork of the Original Goomba Plugin by Flyflo

# Features

- Stomp to kill: Land on enemies from above to deal massive damage.

- Custom sounds & effects: Plays configurable stomp and rebound sounds, plus optional particle effects.

- Rebound jumps: Stomping launches you back up for stylish multi-stomps.

- Configurable damage system:

- Scales with victim’s health (goomba_dmg_lifemultiplier).

- Flat bonus damage (goomba_dmg_add).

- Immunity rules: Prevent stomps or stomping under special conditions (Uber, Bonk, Cloak, Stun, etc.).

- Friendly fire support (requires tf_avoidteammates 1 and mp_friendlyfire 1).

- Disguise handling: Stomps can force Spies out of disguise.


#  Installation

1. Compile `goomba.sp` with SourceMod.

2. Place `goomba.smx` into your `addons/sourcemod/plugins` folder.

3. Add the included sounds to your `sound/goomba/` directory:
    - `stomp.wav`
    - `rebound.wav`

4. Ensure your FastDL is set up so clients download the sounds.
